    return f"""Nestled between the jungle and the beach, Envision Festival is an awakening of the soul. Through an emphasized focus on our pillars of movement, spirituality, music, art, health, sustainability and education, it is so much more than just a music festival.
Envision's mission is to create an eye-opening experience that turns us onto a new form of living; a new way to be inspired. To provide tools that can be integrated into the life we are already living or to inspire a complete shift in our life path. The connection to nature can be felt in every aspect of Envision and the ripple effect of what people then take away from the festival is much more potent than just a good party.
